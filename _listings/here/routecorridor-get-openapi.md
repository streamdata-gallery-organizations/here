  title: HERE Custom Location Extension API Find Locations along a pre-defined Route
  description: |-
    *Request a list of user-defined locations along a pre-defined route*

    The route has been pre-calculated and the `routeid` has already been acquired from a previous routing request. A route-based corridor search is requested using the `corridor` endpoint and by adding the `routeid` parameter to the request URL, along with a corridor `width`.



    * **layerId**  `text`
     \- Unique indicator used to retrieve a dataset

    * **routeId**  `text`
     \- A <b>previously</b> calculated routeId

    * **radius**  `number`
     \- Width of the search corridor

    * **limit**  `number`
     \- The limit of the number of items contained in the response.

    * **app_id**  `text`
     \- A 20 byte Base64 URL-safe encoded string used for the authentication of the client application.    You must include an `app_id` with every request.

    * **app_code**  `text`
     \- A 20 byte Base64 URL-safe encoded string used for the authentication of the client application.    You must include an `app_code` with every request.
